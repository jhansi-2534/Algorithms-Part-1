 * Question 2: Search in a bitonic array
 * An array is bitonic if it is comprised of an increasing sequence of integers
 * followed immediately by a decreasing sequence of integers. Write a program
 * that, given a bitonic array of N distinct integer values, determines whether
 * a given integer is in the array.
 *
 * Standard version: Use ~3lgN compares in the worst case.
 * Signing bonus: Use ~2lgN compares in the worst case (and prove that no
 * algorithm can guarantee to perform fewer than ~2lgN compares in the worst case).

/**
 * Solution:
 *
 * Use three binary searches.
 * 1) Locate the point in the array where ascending switchines to descending
 * 2) Perform binary search on each half of the array for the target integer
